The Flight Log Management System is a web application that allows user to securely manage and store flight logs. 

The project employs the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture pattern to segregate concerns and organise the coding. It enables user authentication, role-based access, and a wide range of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) activities for flight log management. This software is developed with PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS, and jQuery. It can offer user-friendly interface and robust backend for managing flight log information.
